The system is to identify a square that the move adds sight to, adding additional information for disambiguation.

<piece that moves> <action representing rank and disambiguation> <file>

Steps to generate notation

Name the origin piece acording to the chart below.
See how that piece needs to be disambiguated, choose action accordingly
Choose a square they will see from the new location, that they didn't see before
Identify rank
Name action
Identify file
Name file

Pawns:
Soos

Actions - Virtuous/Non-Virtuous
Rank - Left/Right

(REVERSE THIS)

(if left most piece, then virtuous action, if right most, non-virtuous)
(if pawns (Soos), same in order to differentiate ambiguouty)

Disambiguating pawns?


# Linking moves
The cause is what links effect and action.

Cause: Effect 

Stan: Subject

Noun Verb Noun Object

To differentiate origin...... Maybe left most doesn't have an article of clothing???

(Most memorable seen square)

1. e4 c5. 
Soos hugs mabel with virtuous intent.  Soos  tells a truth to mabel with virtuous intent. Soos X Stan with bad intent. Soos hugs mabel bad intent. Soos bad hug mabels. Ford hugs mabel. Ford hugs mabel with bad intent. Dipper lies to Ford. Dipper hug Ford. Soos heels dipper. Soos lies to Stan. Dipper harming Stan. Dipper hug ford. Dipper swears an oath to mabel. Stan harms Ford. Ford lies to Dipper.




Instead of good/bad intent, what about ulterior motive? If a case is ambiguous, that there is  ulterior motive is stated, otherwise in this cases we assume there is none.



Soos (pawn) hugs (4, virtuous to pawns origin square) Mabel (Queen's file). Soos (pawn) tells a truth (left quadrant) to Mabel (queen file).

[maybe descriptor of mabel here to get the second move instead of the next section?]

2. Nf3 d6
Ford (knight move) lies (right side, 5) Stan (King's file). Soos lies (5, right Stan) to Stan.

3. d4 cd4
Separate rules for pawns. A pawn's origin square, pairs of good intent, bad intent.

Soos (pawn) lies to Dipper.  

Mabel's side of the board is virtuous, Stans side is non-virtue



Taking = Killing?

Acting piece differentiation:
    Action (virtuous if file, non-virtuous if rank)

    Every move sees a new square
        Every move sees a new file or rank.

(a.i. generated examples)

Due to: "Ford bandages Mabel at the Bunker due to Stan applauding at the Arcade."
As a result: "Wendy grabs the food at Greasy's Diner as a result of Soos farting at the Water Tower."
Thus: "Mabel carries the items from the Cemetary, thus Stan applauds at the Arcade."
Consequently: "Stan applauds at the Arcade; consequently, Ford bandages Mabel at the Bunker."
Hence: "Soos hides at Hoo-Ha's Owl, hence Mabel carries the items from the Cemetary."
Because of this: "Wendy grabs the food at Greasy's Diner because of this, Soos hides at Hoo-Ha's Owl."
For this reason: "Ford bandages Mabel at the Bunker, for this reason, Dipper dances at Makeout Point."
Leads to: "Stan applauding at the Arcade leads to Ford bandaging Mabel at the Bunker."
Therefore: "Mabel carries the items from the Cemetary; therefore, Wendy grabs the food at Greasy's Diner."
Thus leading to: "Soos farting at the Water Tower, thus leading to Dipper dancing at Makeout Point."

Location information is added when it is ambiguious with regards to the origin file or rank. 

Soos at the water tower dancing, because he ate food. Thus leading to Mabel dancing in the forest in solidarity. This could be seen by Mabel in the forest, who conjures

What changes about the story is what's unique in terms of object/action/location. The current issue with the system is often it'll be the same location each time

# The method
First! An Obligatory (Satirical) Clickbait Title (OCT):

**Chess, Gravity Falls, Buddhism, and the Ancient Art of Memory** 

I decided to use a different method in the end, but I wanted to finish the one I began because I HATE unfinished projects and leaving communities hanging. And I do want this to become a community I'm part of. Hopefully ya'll are cool with a noisy, melodramatic, trans female millennial (I know, redundant).

First, a major issue with this system that will become immediately apparent: It does not support having three of the same piece. If someone picks this up, they'll have to  solve that. It also doesn't address promotion.

HOWEVER! What makes this system different is that it focuses on what a move does versus where the piece is placed. This is an attempt to have this not only be an act of memorization, but that of understanding.

The idea is that each chess move is a person (in my case a character from Gravity Falls, becaue why would I want to think about the real world) doing an action to another person. Ambiguity is dealt with via splitting actions into "virtuous" and "non-virtuous", sub-divided into body and speech.

For a tantalizing touch of ignotum per ignotius: Soos tells a truth to Mabel is moving your pawn to the e4 square. I actually changed the system midway through so the most common chess move wasn't him lying to her.

# System

The general premise is that you identify the piece, then a square that the piece sees after the move. See here is a neutral word for attack/defend. The square it sees could have a piece or not. This is ambiguous when coming up with the nmonic, but not when interpreting it later - as you shall see.

This will translate to Person Action Person.

We will use the `Van Geet Opening: TÃ¼bingen Gambit` as it starts with a piece move and there is a slightly different set of rules for pieces.

This line is: `1. Nc3 Nf6 2. g4`. I'll explain it for those who can't read chess notation.

## Piece (not pawn) moves

### 1. Nc3

(Moving the knight to the c3 square, that's the one in front of the bishop on the left side of the board)

First, identify the piece to move. In the above, it's the currently left most Knight, so in our chart that's Agent Powers.

So we have "Bodacious T"

Next we choose a square that it now sees that it didn't before. We choose a center square because they are important to control and this knight move does just that. The one one we choose is e4, because if we move our pawn there it will then be protected by this knight. Choosing this square is arbitrary, but you should take this moment to think about what the piece move does.

tldr; the square we chose that the knight sees is e4.

The e4 square is on an odd file, so what will be done is a non-virtuous action. The 4th rank's virtuous action is manhandling.

Now, "Bodacious T. Manhandles"

e4 is the E file, which is represented by Stan.

Finally we have "Bodacious T. Manhandles Stan"

### 1. Nf
